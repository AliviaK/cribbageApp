# Weekly Reflections

## Week 1 
    3 hrs setting up environment and brainstorming app details. First week of  
    classes so setting up environment and familiarizing with IntelliJ were the 
    focus points and went well.

## Week 2
     6 hrs completing weekly activities, practicing with GitHub and merging conflicts,
     creating indie project repository and pushing to GitHub, and learning debugger.

## Week 3:
    2/6 
        7:30pm - 11:00pm Reading about JUnit 5 and configuring my Laptop and
                Desktop environments completely. Finished all TODOs for
                ListTest.java but maybe need javadoc? Read about part 2
                and familiarized/got ideas.

    2/7 
        4:00pm - 10:30pm Reading more about JUnit 5 and finishing part 2 of exercise for
                week 3. Got stuck on exception testing and still have questions
                but got discovered javadoc assisting tools in IntelliJ and feel
                more confident with JUnit and TDD.
## Week 4:
    2/8
        Creating Hibernate database for cribbage app, and beginning with user object.
        Added very simple interface to search users by username or show all.
    
    2/13
        Planning for weekly division of work for all classes and project fit into work 
        schedule, and hopefully this structure wil help keep me on track and conceptualize
        what I can get done in small time frames. 
    
    2/14
        Completed the addition of the User DAO in my indie project with relative ease. 
        Will be doing more of this when I create my game database.
