- As a person who likes a versatile gameplay, I want 2, 3, or 4 player options so
  I can have different game experiences. 
  
- As an infrequent user, I want an account that tracks my games played by date
  so that I can see my progress over time. 
  
- As someone who likes customization, I want to be able to control my color
  scheme so that I can create my ideal interface. 
  
- As an inexperienced computer user, I want an easy-to-follow layout so that I 
  can get to and set up my game with ease. *
